= RepoHatch

Chrome extension that helps you to access your repositories pages with the minimum effort from the address bar.

Type some part of your repository name in the chrome address bar and the extension will complete the name and let you choose to access pull requests, issues or "search in the master" pages. The extension will use fuzzy search so even if you type your repository name partially wrong it will still be able to find it.

== Configure

Once you install the extension you will need to generate a GitHub access token. The following image shows the required permissions:
